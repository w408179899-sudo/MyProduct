# VmmSharpEx

Custom Vmmsharp fork based on [Ulf Frisk's MemProcFS](https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS) targeting bleeding edge .NET Core for Windows x64. Also includes the Native Libraries in the build process so you don't need to hunt them down (all files digitally signed).

## Getting Started
[Get it on NuGet!](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VmmSharpEx)
```pwsh
Install-Package VmmSharpEx
```
This library is **Windows Only**, and only bundles/targets the Windows x64 native libraries.
